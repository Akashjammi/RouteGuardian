Project Overview
Our application is designed to streamline school bus management with three key modules: Admin, Driver, and Parent. The Parent module provides a live interface allowing parents to track their child's school bus in real-time, enhancing safety and convenience. Using GPS tracking from the driver's device, location updates are automatically transmitted to parents, ensuring they can monitor the bus's progress and estimated arrival time accurately.

Key Features
Parent Module: Parents gain access to a user-friendly interface where they can track the precise location of their child's bus. This feature promotes peace of mind by offering real-time updates on bus movements throughout the route.

Driver Module: Drivers can efficiently manage student attendance using the app. By marking attendance digitally, they streamline the process and ensure accurate records are maintained, improving operational efficiency and accountability.

Admin Module: Administrators have comprehensive oversight of all school buses and operations. They can track multiple buses simultaneously, view route histories, and manage onboard activities such as adding new buses or registering students. This centralized control enhances administrative efficiency and supports proactive decision-making.

Technology Stack
The application leverages modern technologies to ensure reliability, scalability, and real-time functionality. It utilizes GPS tracking for location updates, integrates secure authentication mechanisms for user roles, and employs a responsive design for seamless usability across devices.

This project demonstrates our commitment to enhancing school transportation management through innovative technology solutions, prioritizing safety, efficiency, and transparency for all stakeholders involved.
