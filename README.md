# Project Overview

Our application simplifies school bus management through three modules: **Admin**, **Driver**, and **Parent**. The *Parent module* provides a live interface enabling parents to track their child's school bus in real-time for enhanced safety and convenience. The bus's location is tracked from the *driver's device* during the trip, ensuring accurate updates are relayed to parents promptly.

# Key Features

## Parent Module
Parents access a user-friendly interface to monitor their child's bus location in real-time, offering peace of mind with accurate updates throughout the journey.

## Driver Module
Drivers can efficiently manage student attendance by digitally marking it within the app, enhancing operational efficiency and accountability.

## Admin Module
Administrators oversee all buses and operations, tracking multiple buses simultaneously, viewing route histories, and managing onboard activities like adding new buses or registering students. This centralized control enhances administrative efficiency and supports proactive decision-making.

# Technology Stack

The application leverages modern technologies for reliability, scalability, and real-time functionality:
- GPS tracking for accurate location updates
- Secure authentication mechanisms for user roles
- Responsive design for seamless usability across devices

This project exemplifies our dedication to improving school transportation management through innovative technology solutions, prioritizing safety, efficiency, and transparency for all stakeholders.
